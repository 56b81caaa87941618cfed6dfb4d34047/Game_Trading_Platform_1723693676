Following this, the user requested a blood red background, prompting the AI to ask whether the change should be site-wide or for specific sections, and whether the text colors should be adjusted for visibility. The user indicated a desire for the blood red background, leading the AI to confirm it would implement that change.\n\nNext, the AI offered a selection of additional features for potential implementation, including night mode, a color palette selector, and options for user-uploaded backgrounds. The user then expressed interest in changing the background to dark green, prompting the AI to seek clarification on whether the user had a specific shade in mind or preferred best practice recommendations, as well as the extent of the change's application. The user confirmed the desire for a dark green background, which the AI acknowledged and indicated it would proceed with, subsequently asking for more details about the project.",
